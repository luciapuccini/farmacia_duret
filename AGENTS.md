## Page Structure

For each page, we adhere to the following folder structure:

- A `page` folder which contains:
  - `index.tsx`: The React component of the page.
  - `.module.scss`: The CSS module for styling the component.

This structure ensures a consistent and organized approach to building our application's interface. Each page's style and functionality are encapsulated, making the components easily maintainable and scalable.
